# Movie Recommendation System

Welcome to the Movie Recommendation System repository! This project implements a movie recommendation system using content-based filtering. It suggests movies similar to a user-selected movie based on their genres and plot descriptions.

## Introduction

This repository contains the backend and frontend code for a movie recommendation system. The backend performs content-based filtering using movie genres and plot descriptions, while the frontend provides an interactive interface for users to explore recommended movies.

## Structure

- **Backend_Code**: Contains the Jupyter notebook (`MovieRecommendation.ipynb`) for implementing the recommendation system.
- **Frontend_Code**: Houses the Streamlit app (`app.py`) for the user interface.

## Data Preprocessing

The dataset used includes information about movies, such as genres and plot summaries. Data preprocessing involves cleaning and transforming this data to extract relevant features for recommendation.

## Running the Application

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- PyCharm (optional, for frontend development)
- Streamlit

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd movie-recommendation-system
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

1. **Backend (Jupyter Notebook)**:

   ```bash
   cd Backend_Code
   jupyter notebook MovieRecommendation.ipynb
   ```

   Run the notebook to generate necessary models and data files.

2. **Frontend (Streamlit App)**:

   ```bash
   cd Frontend_Code
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

   Open `http://localhost:8501` in your web browser to interact with the movie recommendation system.



### Large Files Handling

Large files such as the similarity matrix are not included in the repository due to size constraints. They can be generated by running the backend notebook (`MovieRecommendation.ipynb`).

## Future Enhancements

- Incorporate collaborative filtering for personalized recommendations.
- Scale the system for larger datasets using distributed computing frameworks like Apache Spark.
